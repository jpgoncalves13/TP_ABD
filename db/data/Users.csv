2.  A traditional rule governing the case of personal pronouns after forms of the verb to be  is that the nominative or subjective form ( I; she; he; we; they ) must be chosen. Some 400 years ago, owing to the feeling that the postverb position in a sentence is object rather than subject territory, me  and other objective pronouns ( him; her; us; them ) began to replace the subjective forms after be,  so that It is I  became It is me.</p>

<p>I began my professional career working for consulting firms, then started my own software company and created 17 programs providing speech therapy to stroke survivors .  I marketed and sold it worldwide.  A few years ago, I fully automated my company so it wouldn’t need my involvement, freeing me for new challenges.  I’ve spent my career helping technical and non-technical stakeholders understand each other’s needs.</p>
<p>A few years ago, I returned to consulting, sharpening my skills in areas that I most enjoyed as a business owner. As I took classes and read a wide range of books, what particularly resonated was the importance of listening.  For example, each sale happens in the prospect’s mind. They know what they want. They’ll tell us if we ask and listen with genuine curiosity.   I first learned this selling our software. After I explained what a patient needed, caregivers often asked “how did you know exactly what we need?”.  I just smiled, never revealing my secret: I asked curious questions. You <em>told</em> me. I <em>listened</em>.  It turns out, that’s helpful in all sales, and all communication.</p>
<p>I’ve loved consulting with a variety of businesses, but I miss learning &amp; growing with a team working toward a common purpose.</p>

I started my professional career doing web development before the bubble (the one around 2001) using ASP, PERL, Java and SQL.  Over the years I have spent a lot of time programming for the web and the desktop.

The current app I am building is an Angular2 app using ngrx, based on a stack that includes WebApi, SQL Server Datawarehouse, and nifty languages like C#, TypeScript, SQL, and LESS.

<p>Prior to that, I was the CEO and cofounder of <a href=""http://www.sonoplot.com"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">SonoPlot, Inc.</a> SonoPlot manufactures and sells robotic systems for the printed electronics and biological research markets. I also used to do Mac and iOS development on the side via my one-man company <a href=""http://www.sunsetlakesoftware.com"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Sunset Lake Software</a>, with a particular focus on the iPhone and iPad.</p>
<p>I released an open-source molecular modeler for Mac and iOS called <a href=""http://www.sunsetlakesoftware.com/molecules"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Molecules</a>, and plan to open source my former equation editor called <a href=""http://www.sunsetlakesoftware.com/picubed"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Pi Cubed</a> as well. I'm the author of an open source framework called <a href=""https://github.com/BradLarson/GPUImage2"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">GPUImage</a> which lets you perform GPU-accelerated filtering of images and video on Mac, iOS, and Linux.</p>
<p>I also taught a course on advanced iPhone development at the Madison Area Technical College, for which the fall and spring semesters' videos can be found on <a href=""http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewCourse?id=497193807&amp;s=143441&amp;ls=1"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">iTunes U</a>.

<p>Who am I?  About me?  I am a father of two amazing children: bright happy and filled with energy. I am a husband, of one amazing woman.
I say I like to run, but I don't do it, I say I love to code, and I do it almost as often as I can.
I used to do WingChun, and in some ways it defines who I turned into.  A man who loves simple logic.  Low level where and when I can.  I like to find the rules and then twist them about, bending but never break them.</p>

<p><strong>Goodbye Delphi!</strong><br />
March 2020 headline: Delphi is about to fall out of the TIOBE index top 20.<br />

<p>Jan 2022
Delphi is climbing back towards Top10.
Tiobe is AGAIN wrong!<br />
Embarcadero did a good job with its Community license.</p>
<p><strong>Delphi is 2nd most hated language.</strong><br />
Congrats Embarcadero!<br />

<p><strong>Why Borland failed?</strong></p>
<p>The Borland Turbo languages where the Cat's Pajamas.<br />
Microsoft countered with the Quick languages.<br />
Borland made Turbo Pascal for Windows and with Objects and then made Delphi.<br />
Microsoft countered with Visual BASIC.<br />
Borland made Borland C++ and JBuilder.<br />
Microsoft countered with Visual C++ and Visual J++/J# and then later Visual C#.
The free IDEs and Free compiler languages ate into Borland's sales. Eclipse, Netbeans, IntelliJ, BlueJ, Sublime Text, GNU C/C++, Apple XCode, FreePascal/Lazarus, Ruby/Ruby on Rails, Python, Code::Blocks, etc.<br />
In 2005 Microsoft introduce Visual Studio Express a free version of their development tools.
Like Amiga, Borland had the superior technology, but cheaper/free alternatives undercut their sales.
Mostly, it was the free and open source revolution that did Borland in. orionblastar</p>

62576,24564,Ken White,2009-02-04T19:31:57.810,"<p>I've been programming since the early days of <code>dBASE III+</code>, working in <code>dBASE</code>, <code>FoxPro</code>, <code>Clipper</code>, <code>C</code>, <code>C++</code>, <code>x86 assembler</code>, and <code>Delphi</code> (since version 1 was released). I also have experience with (but am in no way an expert on) <code>SQL Server</code>, <code>Oracle</code>, <code>Interbase</code>, and <code>Advantage Database Server</code> SQL database engines. I've also dabbled in various other languages and technologies such as Java development for Android, Basic4Android, Delphi Prism, C#, and others.</p>

<p>I've also worked in various scopes, from an independent consultant and contract programmer to being employed by a Fortune 10 company and government agencies (State and Federal).</p>

<p>I'm a veteran of the US Air Force, serving both in flight line operations and administrative positions for five years in locations across the US.</p>

<p>I co-authored a <code>Delphi/C++Builder</code> function and component library (<code>Clipper Functions for Delphi</code>, or <code>CFD</code>), initially starting off as a function library to ease the transition from <code>Clipper</code> (a DOS programming language) to <code>Delphi</code> (an OOP Pascal Windows language). At one point <code>CFD</code> had more than 5,000 registered users, and maintained a 100% upgrade rate for the final three versions released. We had customers on every continent except the Antarctic. I still have users today that contact me for updated versions for new Delphi releases (as recently as late 2012), even though the last official release was in 2000.</p>

<p>Software and libraries I've written have been used by top corporations (including some of the major telecommunications companies). I also wrote (under contract to a corporation based in Dallas, TX) one of the early QuickBooks API applications sold on the Intuit website in 2001.</p>

<p>I currently work with medical claims adjudication software, Ansi X12 EDI, insurance billing, and other health care related software, as well as network administration (Novell Netware and Windows 2003/2008), and document storage.</p>

I can be contacted through <a href=""https://mailhide.io/e/xK6Ya"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this reCAPTCHA</a> (requires JavaScript to be allowed from <em>google.com</em> and possibly other(s)). Make sure to make the subject <em>specific</em> (I said: <strong><em>specific</em></strong>. Repeat: <strong>specific</strong> subject required). I can not stress this enough - 90% of you can not compose a specific subject, but instead use some generic subject. <i><b>Use a specific subject, damn it!</b></i> You still don't get it. It can't be that difficult to provide a specific subject to an email instead of a generic one. For example, including meta content like ""quick question"" is unhelpful. Concentrate on the actual subject. Did I say 
<i>specific</i>? I think I did. Let me repeat it just in case: use a <i>specific</i> subject in your email (otherwise it will no be opened at all).

<p>&quot;You need to realize that when you practice from the state of the
beginner all the way to the stage of immutable wisdom, then you must
go back to the status of the beginner again.</p>
<p>""Let me explain in terms of *programming*. As a beginner you know nothing of *statements* or *regular expressions*, so you have nothing in yourself
to dwell on mentally. If someone asks you to *program*, you just *program*
without thinking of anything. 
<p>""Then, when you learn various things like *classes*, how to wield a *regular expression*, where to place your attention, and so on, your
mind lingers on various points, so you find yourself all tangled up
when you try to *code*. 
<p>""But if you practice day after day and month after month, eventually *statements* and *structure* don't hang on your mind anymore,
and you are like a beginner who knows nothing.""

<p>I'm a software developer who relishes authoring HTML and CSS on the web and hacking C# on their self-built Windows PC. I adore Jesus and the colors green, purple and teal, and I often catch myself thinking in numbers and code on a whim. I was also a <a href=""https://mvp.microsoft.com/en-us/PublicProfile/5002751"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Microsoft MVP</a> from 2017 through 2020.</p>
<p>My areas of specialty are in web design — I've known HTML and CSS for more than a decade now! — and Windows app development with C# and XAML. Other languages I've worked with include (from most to least experience) PHP, SQL, ActionScript, Swift, Objective-C, Perl, Python, and Java.</p>
<h2>Roles on this site</h2>
<p>From the tags I participate in (below) as well as my bio (above), it's easy to tell that I'm interested in a number of languages and topics. However, you'll most often find me patrolling, curating and moderating the following tags:</p>
<p><a href=""/questions/tagged/html"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;html&#39;"" rel=""tag"">html</a><a href=""/questions/tagged/css"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;css&#39;"" rel=""tag"">css</a><a href=""/questions/tagged/css-selectors"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;css-selectors&#39;"" rel=""tag"">css-selectors</a><a href=""/questions/tagged/internet-explorer"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;internet-explorer&#39;"" rel=""tag"">internet-explorer</a><a href=""/questions/tagged/microsoft-edge"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;microsoft-edge&#39;"" rel=""tag"">microsoft-edge</a></p>
<p>As a moderator, I believe I am more efficient than ever with post revisions and other housekeeping duties, as I continue with my question-answering business. While I actively add fresh content to the site, I'm also helping out with cleaning and polishing our currently-existing posts. &quot;Dust tends to settle&quot;, and all that jazz.</p>

<p><p>&quot;According to Larry Wall in &quot;Programming Perl&quot;, 2nd Edition, O'Reilly &amp; Associates, 1996, the original author of the Perl programming language, there are three great virtues of a programmer; Laziness, Impatience and Hubris</p></p>
<p>Laziness: The quality that makes you go to great effort to reduce overall energy expenditure. It makes you write labor-saving programs that other people will find useful and document what you wrote so you don't have to answer so many questions about it.</p>
<p>Impatience: The anger you feel when the computer is being lazy. This makes you write programs that don't just react to your needs, but actually anticipate them. Or at least pretend to.</p>
<p>Hubris: The quality that makes you write (and maintain) programs that other people won't want to say bad things about."" &mdash; <a href=""http://threevirtues.com"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Three Virtues</a></p>

For over 20 years, he's never gone more than a couple months without programming something; even while getting a degree in physics. Quinn has always been looking for ways to improve the code he writes, and the code of fellow developers. After being introduced to FAST Agile (<a href=""http://www.fast-agile.com/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://www.fast-agile.com/</a>), TDD, and XP practices - he's become a vocal advocate for their adoption.</p>

<p>After an opportunity to learn from Object Oriented Programming from Fred George, Quinn has taken these practices to heart. His blog (<a href=""https://QuinnGil.com"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://QuinnGil.com</a>) exists to record his experimentation of Object Oriented Programming. Less than a year after glomming onto actual Object Oriented Programming, Quinn coined ""MicroObjects"" (<a href=""https://QuinnGil.com/uobjects/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://QuinnGil.com/uobjects/</a>) as a development style to produce highly maintainable code, quickly, with a low defect rate.</p>

I'm mostly familiar with the .NET stack. I also spend part of the year in Europe too, because I can; I value irreverence and I identify as a reluctant nihilist.</p>
<p>(Just don't call me a &quot;full-stack&quot; engineer - there's more to software than a &quot;back-end&quot; vs. &quot;front-end&quot; dichotomy: think about embedded and robotics, industrial control, avionics, systems programming <sub>(with Rust of course, not C, what's wrong with you?)</sub>, and so on.</p>
<p>Prior to the startup scene I was gainfully employed at Microsoft as a Software Engineer for the Chakra JavaScript engine (Edge and Internet Explorer), prior to that I worked on Expression Blend and Visual Studio.</p>
<p>I like to think I have extensive experience in C# and the .NET Framework, and modest experience in C++. Prior to Microsoft I worked on web-applications and web-services using ASP.NET Web Forms, ASP.NET MVC, and WCF. I also have experience in PHP, Java and other non-Microsoft platforms and technologies for which I'm happy to answer questions about. I also know far too much about end-of-life'd Microsoft platforms, products, services and technologies from the mid-1990s to the mid-2000s - that's what happens when you read technical manuals <em>for fun</em> as a teenager. I am aware this is not normal.</p>
<p>I have high blood pressure from being constantly frustrated by limitations in type-systems and expressivity in programming languages - and StackOverflow users who actively disregard the posting guidelines about <em>not posting screenshots</em> (or even <em>photos of their screen</em>) of code in their questions.</p>
<p>I also <em>recreationally</em> reformat SQL in other peoples' StackOverflow posts into my own opinionated style, without prior informed consent, because it's oddly theraputic.</p>

<p>Our careers and hobbies are fun and important. But each of us has a soul which will live forever, after our bodies die. Do you know where you'll spend eternity? Jesus Christ said there is only one way to heaven, and it is through Him. You won't get a second chance after you die.</p>

<p>I probably did <strong>not</strong> downvote you, so don't assume that just because I'm the only one responding to your question that it was me. The vast majority of the time I will try to probe you to make your question, answer or comment better.</p>
<p>I follow the <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/php"">PHP tag</a> pretty regularly. I'll also help with WordPress-related posts, unless the question is about a specific plugin or theme, or about Gutenberg, in which case it should probably be posted over on <a href=""https://wordpress.stackexchange.com/"">WordPress Dev</a>.</p>
<p>I tend to comment way more than answer because I hold the quality of my answers very high. If something can be solved with a two or three sentence comment, I'm probably not going to post that as an answer. With that knowledge, if I post a comment that is helpful and I don't answer, I hereby grant everyone, including the OP themselves, permission to write an answer based on that. Courtesy says you should acknowledge the comment, but I won't lose any sleep if you don't.</p>
<p><em>(My commenting policy really bugged this one person once, and they actually told me that I shouldn't post <em>anything</em> in that case. Something like &quot;If you can't be bothered to write a quality answer, you should leave this to other people that will&quot;. Hmm, no, I will always try to help someone if I think I can.)</em></p>
<p>I also like talking and writing about technical things, and given the stage, I can go <a href=""https://vendiadvertising.com/insight/website-metrics-everything-you-need-know-about-bounce-rate-google-analytics"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">on</a> and <a href=""https://vendiadvertising.com/insight/4-steps-building-website"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">on</a> and <a href=""https://vendiadvertising.com/insight/content-management-system"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">on</a>.</p>

In the late 80s and early 90s, I was involved in early modeling and code generation tools that reached the marketplace, including a tool that modeled FORTRAN programs and generated FORTRAN for parallel supercomputer architectures, and a tool that managed Shlaer-Mellor models and generated C++ code. Over the years, I have applied Shlaer-Mellor, UML, and custom modeling and various code generation techniques to greatly benefit the development of enterprise applications.</p>

<p>My current passion and endeavor is to foster the evolution of model oriented development.  In particular, I am passionate about evolving the Mo+ model oriented programming language and related model driven development tools, with as much community input as possible to achieve higher levels in the ability to create and maintain code. The open source site is at moplus.codeplex.com, and the Mo+ membership site is at modelorientedplus.com.</p>

<p>I know and use different computer languages (at least 10). My favorite and mostly used languages are C#, C and C++.<br/></p>

<p>I have intensive experience with Windows NT systems since October 1992 Beta of Windows NT 3.1. All time I tried study different Windows API and internals from both programming and administrative side. In 1993 I was one of the first beta testers on Microsoft SMS 1.0 in Europa with visits of developers in Redmond and so on. Since the time I know good problems of software installation and deployment.<br/></p>

<p>I worked long time as IT consulting (for large companies) for different technologies (mostly from Microsoft) in both back-end and front-end, but software development is my favor. Because of that I developed a lot of different tools for IT administrators. Since I have a daughter and later a son I implement mostly projects with software development to see more my family.<br/></p>

<p>In software development I developed different stuffs from driver development, NT services development up to COM, DCOM, RPC development and different Network technology.<br/></p>

<p>I have very broad spectrum of interest. Currently I mostly interesting in: WFC RESTfull services, ASP.NET MVC, Security, jQuery, jqGrid, JavaScript. I am a perfectionist and like searching and using of the best, optimizes technologies, which perfect match to the solving problem.<br/></p>

<p>I like to find and solve problems. Complex problems I like mostly. My typical projects are on the edge between software development and complex IT requirements from the administrative side.<br/></p>

<p>I think that there are no stupid questions, only different points of view. So I use only voting up and no voting down and try to help as more people as possible.<br/></p>

<p>Since more as 10 years I am self-employed. My own small company is OK soft GmbH.

Because they are the same team. Toxic community of ungrateful inadequate people who censor me and delete my content just because I responsibly follow the official rules of SO that they don't follow. They are blatantly violating multiple SO rules, they are collectively stalking, downvoting and deleting random answers of mine just to show that nothing can stop them because they are moderators. Such behaviour isn't professional, it is disgusting and shameful. They are such mean people that even write insults on me in comments. When I flags insults the flags get ignored. No matter what is written in rules of SO they don't work because moderators are promoting different rules -- such that allow people to insult you in comments, calling you bad words, saying that you are handicapped and other things. Moderators refuse to remove such comments and if you create a post in Meta to highlight the problem, instead of acting and fixing it they only write even more insults on you -- the Meta website is a trap place where they call you to come to throw even more trash on you, publicly insult and demean you. Do not believe moderators -- they always lie and censor everything that would expose it.</p>

<p>Originally, I was going to go with an Atari... but it was a big expense for my family... and after months of me nagging, my dad agreed to buy an Apple ][.  The few months in childhood seem to last forever.  A few months nowadays seem to pass like days.  Those days, a computer had 16kb or 48kb of RAM.  Today, the computer has 16GB.  So it is in fact a million times.</p>
<p>A floppy disk as I remember had 143kb, and it was already a luxury. Many people who couldn't afford a floppy disk drive had to use a tape recorder and cassette tapes that usually is used for music to record their programs. And then the floppy disk went to 1.4MB... the hard drive went from 20MB in about 1986 to 200MB in 1991, and then 1GB, 2GB, 16GB, 200GB, 500GB, 1TB, 4TB, 18TB.</p>
<p>I do feel it this way: if the hard drive is 2GB max, you can wait a couple of months or even half a year and nothing changes. The price stays the same and the capacity do not change at all. But if you look at 143kb vs 18TB, that's mind blowing.</p>
<p>Processors went from 1MHz (of Apple]['s 6502) to today's 5GHz, so it is 5000 times. If we consider it 9 cores and hyperthreading, then it is 90,000 times.</p>

<p>Happily employed at Wilderness Travel as engineering lead on our Portal project (react/rails), and senior contributor and mentor on our other code bases and systems. I am open to entrepreneurial side-collaborations that match my interests. Reach out!</p>
<p>On the Org side of things I'm interested in team leadership, management, building effective processes, non-violent communication, interpersonal skills, emotional intelligence, mentoring, and deep understanding of business value.</p>
<p>On the Build side, I'm comfortable from icon to iron. I craft attractive &amp; tested applications &amp; systems. I have specialized enough to produce quality products at a respectable speed on my own. I've diversified enough to have learned the enduring principles of software design, and to acquire new toolsets with confidence and grace. I've studied enough to have a working knowledge of most major languages and frameworks in use today. I've collaborated enough to know what types of work environments I thrive in and types of collaborators I thrive with. I've lived enough to know that life is too short to work too much.</p>
<p>For 15 years as a freelancer I worked to become a sharpshooter, honing a toolset to quickly produce custom apps for private clients. In the last 10 years I focused on Javascript, Ruby, Rails, and UX design. My current frontend preference is react/redux. With a previous employer I worked in Ember/Rails on a large agile team. I've built a React/Redux a Chrome extension for Mandarin learners called Chinese Console. I've have several active entrepreneurial projects that generate passive income and have taught me about running small businesses.</p>
<p>I have developed in PHP, Java, Python, and even Perl back when the web was young and we didn't know any better. I started in the field as a graphic designer who fell in love with programming, and consider myself as much a designer as an engineer. I keep up to date with tools and methodologies through podcasts, conventions, events, &amp; meetups in San Francisco, and a long reading list.</p>
<p>Outside of tech, I'm a trained language teacher (MaEd), interpreter &amp; linguaphile. I'm interested in the fields of language education, linguistics &amp; computer-assisted language learning.</p>
<p>I practice NVC, have spent decades learning dances, foreign languages, musical instruments, traveling, and have a black belt in dog petting.</p>

It was no surprise that I choose to study Computing Science in university. I did this at the University of Technology in Eindhoven. I also spent some time at the University of Waterloo in Canada, which was great.</p>

<p>Out of university I started working for Ernst &amp; Young consultants; in particular the bunch that worked on big software engineering projects for large companies. I learned a ton and played all sorts of roles from developer to designer to architect to analyst. After 7 years I continued along that path at smaller consultancy companies (DCE Consultants and Yellowtail). </p>

<p>Then in 2011 I thought it was enough. I had built so many (IMHO) great things for my clients, that I finally decided I wanted to build something for myself this time. I picked a niche (digital signage) and built Bizplay, together with a good friend/colleague of mine. Since we launched in March 2012, that has been our adventure. And I'm loving every minute of it. </p>

<p>And since we're bootstrapping, I keep helping out the occasional customer with his software development challenges.</p>

<p>Moderator  ♦  on [English Language and Usage](http://english.stackexchange.com) and Pro Tem ♦ on [Portuguese Language](http://portuguese.stackexchange.com).  I can most easily be reached in real time by pinging me in the [ELU chatroom](http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/95/english-language-usage).
<p>I’m Tom Christiansen, co-author of <em>Programming Perl</em> and <em>Perl Cookbook</em> from O’Reilly. I work for <a href=""http://www.grantstreet.com/careers/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Grant Street Group</a>, who are always looking to <strong>hire more Perl programmers</strong>. I can (sometimes) be reached via email at &lt;tchrist53147@gmail.com&gt;, but that address is heavily spam-filtered so just because you sent me something doesn’t guarantee that I’ll’ve read it. I’ve lived in Colorado for the last quarter century, but have previously lived abroad in Spain and England. I try to spend as much time as I can in the Colorado mountains.</p>
<p>I’ve been doing Unix and C programming since the early 1980s. My programming interests include high-level languages, Unicode, regexes, and operating systems. My old <a href=""http://www.oreilly.com/pub/au/407"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">O’Reilly bio</a> from ages ago mutters various ancient things about me, and some folks have gone and put up <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Christiansen"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">a silly Wikipedia page</a> about me, too. As a kid I lived down the street from <a href=""http://archive.wired.com/wired/archive/8.10/cruise_pr.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Gary Gygax</a> of Dungeons and Dragons fame, and worked for TSR throughout high school. I have ancient undergraduate degrees in Spanish and in Computer Science, plus a graduate degree in compsci focusing on operating systems design and in natural language processing. I’ve studied Spanish, French, Italian, Portuguese, Latin, and German, along with a smattering of related languages thrown in.</p>
<p>The maxim that <em>“If you haven’t lost track of how many languages you’ve learned, you haven’t learned enough of them yet”</em> applies to both programming languages and natural languages alike.</p>

Since 2008 most of my software development has been with Qt and using CMake as the project file generator. This has allowed me to develop on Visual Studio but also build and use some of my applications on 64 bit gentoo linux. With this move I have also moved to using large cross platform libraries like ITK, GDCM, VTK in most of my applications instead of building every thing from scratch.</p>

<li>Understand the motivation and mindset of the users to be able to get the priorities right and be able to come up with the right
solutions,</li>
<li>Staying creative is important and to achieve that we need to continuously give our selves chances to get inspiration.</li>
</ul>

<p>Considering the team as a whole, it is crucial to reach a critical mass of inspired people. These people -- using great technology, working on challenging projects, surrounded by quality devices and software -- will create innovation and inspire each other with their ideas and interesting new approaches, which will lead to further innovation, better quality and real value.</p>

<p>I am a software engineer and architect at Volkswagen Group of America. I write cool software and deal with special under-the-radar projects. </p>

<p>I have been programming for something like 20+ years. I started in your typical languages, and moving into the web-space during the height of the browser wars. I have written code in these languages and many more:</p>

<ul>
<li>Basic (Yay basic!)</li>
<li>Turbo Pascal</li>
<li>Fortran</li>
<li>COBOL</li>
<li>ColdFusion</li>
<li>HTML (I have run into a few people that argue it is a language. Although my argument is always that it's a markup language, not logic - but it is argued, so it makes the list)</li>
<li>JavaScript (because.)</li>
<li>PHP (Keep your jokes to yourself, everyone makes the leap somewhere)</li>
<li>Java </li>
<li>Python</li>
<li>Perl</li>
<li>C++ (It was college)</li>
<li>ASM (never again)</li>
</ul>

<p>That my non-exhaustive list of languages that I remember working with. There are probably more.</p>

<p>So aside from programming languages, I have also worked with the following dialects, scripting, markups, whatever:</p>

<ul>
<li>XML/XSLT</li>
<li>HTML4,5/XHTML</li>
<li>TypeScript</li>
<li>SQL [MySQL, Oracle, MSSQL]</li>
<li>CSS (Yay!)</li>
</ul>

<p>JavaScript Frameworks: React, Angular
JavaScript Frontend Libraries: jQuery, Bootstrap, and a bunch of ones that showed up in the early to mid 2000's.</p>

<p>Einstein (probably) said: <em>Two things are infinite, the universe and human stupidity, and I am not yet completely sure about the universe.</em></p>

<p>After spending some time, reading the questions, here on StackOverflow, I have to admit that, at least about humans, he was right.</p>

<p>I'm good in <strong>downvoting</strong> your questions. I'm downvoting question like:</p>

<ul>
<li>retrive location on Android</li>
<li><strong>NullPointerException</strong> in own code(for FSM sake! use debugger!)</li>
<li><strong>NetworkOnMainThreadException</strong> (search first ask later)</li>

<ul>
<li>My name is Andrew</li>
<li>BS in Computer Science, Minors in Software Engineering and Audio Engineering</li>
<li>Been working in the industry for over 10 years now; have done jobs in everything from web dev, to infrastructure, to middleware, to QA.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Tech</h2>
<ul>
<li>Current job is a mishmash of operating multitenanted Kubernetes the Hard Way™ clusters, writing/maintaining tools to make interfacing with said clusters easier, and general server management with stuff like Terraform, Packer, Ansible, and Puppet.</li>
<li>Most used language: Python</li>
<li>Other langs: bash, Ruby, Go, jq (if awk counts as a language, then so does jq!)</li>
<li>In past lives: Scala (I miss it so), Java, Javascript/Coffeescript, C/C++, Erlang, Prolog, Lisp, SQL/CQL, MIPS</li>
<li>Daily driving a Mac but I do most development on Debian Linux with vim in a tmux session. I haven't upgraded my Sublime Text license. I open an IDE maybe twice a year. vim is love, vim is life.</li>
<li>Have given a few tech talks of varying lengths, no public links though :(</li>
</ul>
<h2>Open Source Contributions</h2>
<p>This is in order of how much code I contributed, the size of the project's userbase, and how impactful/lengthy the change was.</p>
<ul>
<li>Kubernetes</li>
<li>moto</li>
<li>troposphere</li>
<li>Terraform</li>

<li>pam_hook</li>
<li>heckler</li>
<li>cascade</li>
<li>specs2</li>
<li>hubot-meme</li>
</ul>
<h2>Not-programming stuff</h2>
<ul>
<li>I can hold my own in GIMP, Audacity, OBS, and Adobe Premiere (which I loathe, but it's by far the best in class.)</li>
<li>I can do fancy stuff in Excel, but I refuse to on principle.</li>
<li>I have a makeshift recording studio in my apartment. What do you think the Audio Engineering minor was for?</li>
<li>I occasionally make minor contributions to competitive gaming and speedrunning knowledge bases (discovering/proving tech, doing research on input values, making guides, that sort of thing.)</li>

<pre><code>Today I left my phone at home
And went down to the sea.
The sand was soft, the ocean glass,
But I was still just me.

Then pelicans in threes and fours,
Glided by like dinosaurs,
An otter basked upon its back,
And dived to find another snack.

The sun corpuscular and bright,
Cast down a piercing shaft,
And conjured an inspiring sight
On glinting, bobbing craft.

Two mermaids rose up from the reef,
Out of the breaking waves.
Their siren song was opium grief,
Their faces from the grave.

The mermaids asked a princely kiss
To free them from their spell.
I said to try a poet’s bliss.
They shrugged and bid farewell.

The sun grew dark and sinister,
In unscheduled eclipse.
As two eight-headed aliens
Descended in their ships.

They said the World was nice enough
But didn’t like our star.
And asked the way to Betelgeuse,
If it wouldn’t be too far.

Two whales breached far out to sea,
And flew up to the sky,
The crowd was busy frolicking,
And didn’t ask me why.

Today I left my phone at home,
On the worst day, you’ll agree.
If only I had pictures,
If only you could see.

Not everything was really there,
I’m happy to confess,
But I still have the memories,
Worth more than tweets and stress.

Today I left my phone at home,
I had no shakes or sorrow.
If that is what my mind can do,
It stays at home tomorrow.

Gavin Miller

SE Inc has behaved reprehensibly, and the entire user community should be made aware and take a stand against it.</p>

<p>Some people are just arrogant fools who believe changing their user handle every quarter is an effective means to hide their stupidity. But in reality, they are the poster child of their own quips in their &quot;about me&quot; section.</p>

<p>I don't believe in answering questions completely. IMHO, one gains the most when one deduces as much of the answer on their own.</p>

<ul>
<li>The vital importance of being precise.</li>
<li>Helping others learn can enrich oneself immeasurably.</li>
<li>Someone always knows more, learn from them.</li>
</ul>

<li>Do something, anything along the vein of solving the problem that gets you to a resolution</li>
<li>Review it and laugh (laughing is critical to alleviate the stress of solving the problem.)</li>
<li>Now do something right.  Take ideas from the first attempt and use them to evolve a cleaner often simpler solution.</li>
<li>Now make it better.  Find inaccuracies; inefficiencies; or holes in the cleaner solution and develop a more robust, simpler and more accurate solution.   Time doesn't always allow for step 4; but when it does it makes maintenance and future errors easier and less frequent.</li>

To pretend to know when you do not know is a disease</p>

<p>The clever combatant looks to the effect of combined energy, and does not require too much from individuals. Hence his ability to pick out the right men and utilize combined energy</p>

<p>The fool doth think he is wise, but the wise man knows himself to be a fool</p>

<p>He who exercises no forethought but makes light of his opponents is sure to 
be captured by them</p>

<p>In dispelling ignorance, it is not favorable to act as an enemy</p>

<p>To bear with fools in kindliness brings good fortune</p>

<p>In punishing folly
It does not further one
To commit transgressions
The only thing that furthers
Is to prevent transgressions</p>

<p>All day long the superior man is creatively active
At nightfall his mind is still beset with cares</p>

<p>If the superior man undertakes something and tries to lead, he goes astray;
But if he follows, he finds guidance.</p>

<p>The superior man understands the signs of the time and prefers to desist</p>

<p>The wisdom of a learned man cometh by opportunity of leisure; and he that hath little business shall become wise</p>

<p>You are equal to others, but you are not better</p>

<p>Quiet perseverance brings good fortune</p>

<p>Look to your conduct and weigh the favorable signs
When everything is fulfilled, supreme good fortune comes</p>

<p>Know what is in front of your face, and what is hidden from you will be disclosed to you.</p>

<p>Don't let your heart get big because of your knowledge. Take counsel with the ignorant as well as with the scholar</p>

<p>The greatest epiphany can be lost to the simplest distraction</p>

<p>The surest way to remember something is to give it rhythm</p>

<p>Earnestness is the path of immortality, thoughtlessness the path of death</p>

<p>Physical objects are not in space, but these objects are spatially extended</p>

<p>And that you remit the debt as alms. That would be better for you if you understand</p>

<p>The price of reliability is the pursuit of the utmost simplicity. It is a price which the very rich find most hard to pay</p>

<p>It's a curious thing about our industry: not only do we not learn from our mistakes, we also don't learn from our successes</p>

<p>The tools we use have a profound influence on our thinking habits, and therefore, on our thinking abilities</p>

<p>There will never be a universal programming language since no one language is best for all problems</p>

<p>Now I realize that I am the power that commands the feeling of my mind and from which circumstances grow</p>

<p>Remember that man created method, and method did not create man, and do not strain yourself in twisting into someone’s preconceived pattern, which unquestionably would be appropriate for him, but not necessarily for you</p>

<p>What is not subject to choice is fact</p>

<p>It's not that the malicious code <code>understands</code>, they just need to match a pattern</p>

<p>Started learning PHP as a hobby in 2004. I love it so much that now I do it as a profession.</p>

<p>Started as a procedural coder, but now fully into OOP.</p>

<p>I started with CodeIgniter, and while it was a good introduction to frameworks, I quickly outgrew it. I then switched over to Laravel. For all the times I felt like I had to hack the framework to get things to work in CI, I've not run into that issue yet in Laravel, and I'm loving it.</p>

<p>I do a lot of Q&amp;A editing on Stack Exchange. Partly I want to make the information here as useful, clear, and easy to read as possible. Partly I'm satiating my mildly obsessive-compulsive personality. I hope that's ok.</p>
<p>P.S. My handle isn't @isherwood. Just isherwood, thank you very much (after the protagonist in my favorite novel). @ is an operator that directs my attention to your mention of me. Don't use it unless that's your intent.</p>
<p>P.P.S. Isherwood thinks that profile blurbs written in the third person are creepy. He wonders who you commissioned to write it for you (and, apparently, place it in your profile on your behalf).</p>
<p>P.P.P.S. &quot;im&quot; isn't a word in English. If you want to be taken seriously as a professional, put some effort into your written communication. Find your shift key and the apostrophe and use them to properly spell the contraction of &quot;I am&quot;. It's not hard.</p>
<p>While I'm ranting, phrases like &quot;JavaScript select target&quot; are nonsense. We're not a search engine. Please write post titles as though your audience is human.</p>

<p>After some years with smaller companies, I am working as software engineer at a global IT player for more than 15 years by now.</p>
<p>I started programming in Java more or less shortly after Java 1.02 became available. Java is still my main love, but there were hot affairs with C, C++, perl, python, and other, less known languages.</p>
<p>I am very much convinced that the only reasonable way to do &quot;enterprise java&quot; programming is to focus on &quot;clean code&quot; and &quot;tdd/unit testing&quot;.</p>

<p>Laziness: I'm too lazy to do the same task repeatedly so write scripts to do that task for me. This makes people think I am intelligent.</p>

<p>Impatience: I'm too impatient to wait for my code to run so rewrite the code to improve performance. This makes people think I am a good programmer.</p>

<p>Hubris: When someone asks if I can do something I just say Yes, then go find out how to do it (Google!). This makes people think I can do anything.</p>

<p>Ultimately, it means I can make a career out of being Lazy, Impatient, and Hubristic(?).</p>

<p>I'm working intensively with C++11, getting (Almost trying to learn) good modern C++ practices.<br>
I'm specially interested in <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template_metaprogramming"" rel=""nofollow"">C++ template-metaprogramming</a>, my current main project is <a href=""https://github.com/Manu343726/Turbo"" rel=""nofollow"">a library to provide <strong>compile-time utilities using tmp</strong></a>.<br>
Also I'm currently working on a unit testing library for template metaprograms. I really hate to test my metaprograms with <code>static_assert()</code>s only! <em>(Insert future github project link here)</em><br>
I like a lot to play with the language, exploting its capabilities until (Sadly...) the compiler colapses with an internal error.</p>

<p>But not everything are crazy ideas. I have more realistic projects. For example, as a result of my personal frustration with C++ tuples, I'm currently writting a library to enance the capabilities of C++11 tuples, making the day to day work easy: <a href=""https://github.com/Manu343726/TTL"" rel=""nofollow"">The TTL Project</a>.</p>

<h3>But that was not always the case...</h3>

<p>My career as programmer started with Visual Basic 6.0, and a bit later with Visual Basic .NET. A couple of years later I decided to ""port my mind"" to the world of C#, C++, and C. 
That decision have leaded to a wonderfull world of OO programming with C#, close to metal C, and C++ generic programming.</p>

<p>I'm mostly interested in videogame programming, specifically game-engine implementations,
so I have worked with DirectX, such as in <a href=""https://github.com/Manu343726/cpp_lib32"" rel=""nofollow"">my port</a> of the <a href=""https://github.com/VisualStudioEX3/dx_lib32"" rel=""nofollow"">dx_lib32 project</a>.<br>
Before that I have written a <strong>GDI+ based 3d rendering engine from scratch</strong>, using VB.NET and C#.  </p>

<p>Also I have written ""experimental"" projects using C# and the Kinect for Windows SDK, such as <a href=""https://github.com/Manu343726/KinectNormalMap"" rel=""nofollow"">a 3d scanner <strong>to compute normal maps and render the scene</strong> at ""real time""</a>, or a simple <a href=""https://github.com/Manu343726/KinectStick"" rel=""nofollow"">videogame-oriented virtual keyboard which provides <strong>speech and gesture based commands</strong></a>.</p>

<h3>What about Java?</h3>

<p>I really hate the Java programming language (Please note that I said <em>the programming language</em>, not the runtime nor the libraries). It suffers from years of unresolved design errors from its base, a horrible and verbose syntax, and years of not evolving at all (I know about Java 8, but think: That was which C# has 8 years before...). </p>

<p>As you can see I strongly prefer C# as a OO VM-based language (""Managed"", as Microsoft likes to say), but Java is a very common language in the programming world.<br>
So, even if I hate Java, I have an intermediate-low level with it. Thats what I think, but <a href=""https://github.com/Manu343726/WALLE"" rel=""nofollow"">judge by yourselves instead</a>. Also check this SO profile about <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/search?q=user:1609356+[java]"">the Java questions I answered</a>.</p>

<p>It may happen on occassion that a strange, black, ironic, sometimes even sarcastic sense of humor overwhelms me. Doctors have diagnosed this as SPAM-MAPS (SPontAneous <a href=""http://www.montypython.com/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Mp [Multi-Attack Palindrome]</a> Syndrom). It leads to increase in blood pressure, flood of tears, hence visual impairment, inability to eat or drink, intermittent breathing accompanied by weird noises and it is extremly infectious but harmless otherwise.</p>
<p>It is advised to not take things deadly serious then. If you decide to do so nevertheless, please note that you do it at your own risk of suffering from stomachache, a heart attack, a stroke, flatulences[,] killing a butterfly, a fawn, a unicorn or myriads of your neurons.</p>

I finished a masters in <code>Bioinformatic</code> in February 2010. I spent some time in a double roll as lecturer and project leader at a Latin-American university. As a lecturer, I taught Artificial Intelligence for several semesters in the pre-grad program, while as a project leader, my team fulfilled a Bioinformatics software commission from a high research center. From a software-developer's perspective the project implied to work with large databases of genetic data, specially sequence databases, and perform the queries in the shortest possible, time.
Since 2014 and so far I have been working as founder, developer, and project leader at E-Craft LLC/ShimmerCat AB.
My position of developer and project leader of ShimmerCat included both programming , organizing and coordinating work. The projects below are the ones where I did a significant amount of programming work. All of them are production projects, in the sense that they comprise the totality of a company’s revenue.</p>
<ul>
<li>Auto-scaling image processing platform in Kubernetes (Google Cloud), with deep logging and reporting. It currently handles a dozen of large ecommerces and millions of image operations per month.</li>
<li>Customer-facing API systems. Mainly using Django, and Python code.</li>
<li>Deployment scripts to automatically deploy the code to Google Cloud using CI/CD pipelines: Shell Script, Helm, Python, YAML.</li>
<li>Monitoring infrastructure with alerts to monitor the customers servers, and our services: Grafana, Prometheus, Elasticsearch, Kibana, and celery tasks linked to a Django project to generate the dashboards automatically.</li>
</ul>
<p>For all the projects I develop I code lot of unit tests. It is something we learn with the years, even well-written code without tests is hard to maintain.</p>

Some recent projects include Ava, a novel app that helps deaf people communicate in group conversations, Twine, an app that helps people start and develop savings plans, and an internal hospital management app for a hospital chain, backed by GraphQL.</p>

<p>I have experience in getting existing applications back on track, and also in starting new applications from scratch.  From all my professional engineering experience, I have come to appreciate the lasting benefits of clean architecture, and that is my primary focus.  Accordingly, I have experience with applications of MVVM, reactive and unidirectional flow architectures, and have written foundational logic for multi-party chat and distributed systems, caching and connecting to REST and GraphQL backends.</p>

<p><a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/users/2318649/balmy"">https://stackoverflow.com/users/2318649/balmy</a></p>
<p>Please don’t flood some beginner’s question with unrelated comments. Meta Stack Overflow is where discussion of the site itself is on topic.</p>
<p>Slightly older breaking news:</p>
<p>I won’t delete myself only because then this won’t be visible. I’m out of here because the Goderators are unanswerable to the people they’re unaccountably and invisibly trampling over. Scrap, scrape; who cares. Maybe this profile will be Goderated - you’ll never know.</p>
<p>Slightly older breaking news:</p>
<p>Currently distinctly hacked off with the invisble Goderation - you didn’t know it was there, did you? That’s probably because they like sneaking around and deleting stuff without leaving any trace, and apart from one exception I’ll describe below, without telling anyone or even - gasp - <em>you</em> that they’re doing it.</p>
<p>The one exception is when I am prepared to agree I overstepped the thin blue line.</p>
<p>I’m currently considering my position vis-a-vis whether it’s worth bothering with this place given the lack of transparency and accountability of the Goderators.</p>

2386774,2772450,JeffC,2013-05-15T16:34:12.367,"<p>When I was a kid, I fell in love with computers. My first computer was a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaypro"" rel=""nofollow"">KAYPRO I</a> and later a KAYPRO II (CP/M based machines, not MS-DOS). I still remember thinking, ""what in the world am I going to do with 191kb of storage?"" when double-sided floppies came out. I was a hobbyist programmer, starting with BASIC and Turbo Pascal. When I was in college, I found a love for Organic Chemistry and ended up getting a Masters degree in Chemistry. During graduate school I met a guy that introduced me to his recruiter at Microsoft. I ended up getting job offers from a pharmaceutical company and Microsoft. The offer from Microsoft was too exciting to pass up even though it was less money. I spent ten years at Microsoft, five in Word (SDE) and five in SharePoint (SDET I/II).</p>

<p>I've been in software QA for almost 15 years doing both manual and automated testing. Over the years I've written automation in WordBasic and Word VBA but more recently C# and JavaScript. In the last six months or so at work, we changed our focus to Java and Selenium and I do a little C#/Selenium for tools here and there.</p>

<p>Over the years I've spent a lot of time reading blogs of LOTS of Q&amp;As on SO to learn and improve my knowledge of C#, JavaScript, Java, and Selenium. I don't know what I would have done without it. Reading blogs and articles is great but if you don't already know and/or trust the blogger, you may get bad info. SO isn't bullet proof but it's the only place I know of where you can get rated answers which really helps. There's not much you can't find on SO.</p>

My first programming language ever was Logo (at school, when I was like 6), then I moved to more interactive and fun programmable input emulator GlovePie for around a year or 2 when I got my first computer.
Got into web production by reading ""HTML in easy steps"" creating many websites (one for electronics, one for programming, computer parts and my personal one) learning Javascript and PHP in the process.
When I was 18 I proceed to a more high-level programming language - Java (which I am now loving) for computer science, having made many simulations and games using both Graphics2D and  OpenGL, along with also the odd program.</p>

<p>I'm looking forward to sharing the simple answers I have gathered from the hours of internet searching I've done before creating an account on here. I believe many people over-complicate things needlessly so I really hope I can provide many sources of tiny code snippets to help the community.</p>

I happened to grow up during the time that the internet grew up too, and I taught myself HTML and CSS throughout the year. Learned C++, Javascript, PHP, MySQL, and random other bits of coding languages (C#, Python, Ruby)</p>

<h1>Personal</h1>

<p>I'm a bit of a polyglot. I ""know"" a total of four languages: English, Spanish, German, and I am currently learning Russian. I'm unsure why I decided to take the time to learn the languages, but I honestly don't have a plan to stop. Once done with Russian I plan to learn Japanese and then Arabic. From there I'm not entirely sure what, but I'll see where it goes.</p>

<p>Some rules of thumb for new R users (According to myself):</p>
<ol>
<li><p>If you are working with <code>data.frame</code>s, forget there is a function called <code>apply</code>- whatever you do - <em>don't</em> use it. <em>Especially</em> with a margin of 1 (the only good usecase for this function is to operate over <code>matrix</code> columns- margin of 2).</p>
<ul>
<li>Some good alternatives: <code>?do.call</code>, <code>?pmax/pmin</code>, <code>?max.col</code>, <code>?rowSums/rowMeans/etc</code>, the awesome <code>matrixStats</code> packages (for matrices), <code>?rowsum</code> and many more</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>For loops are not bad- don't listen to anyone who says otherwise. They are bad only in certain cases:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you use them to iterate over rows.</li>
<li>If you are performing unvectorized/inefficient operation within each iteration</li>
<li>If you are writing a loop for something that is already vectorized</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>R is a vectorized language- meaning many operation were already written in C loops- so don't reinvent the wheel and write stuff in R loops if it was already written. With one exception- many of these functions work only with matrices. Hence, if you have a <code>data.frame</code> you should think twice if you want it to be converted to a <code>matrix</code>(you may experience some unexpected consequences as a result), or can you avoid it.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Learn base R before you learn any fancy packages</strong> such as <code>dplyr</code>. It is a nice package and all, but it was designed for very specific things. Many many operations could be done much more efficiently using base R.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Get familiar with R classes. Learn what is <code>factor</code> and how to use it. Know the difference between a <code>matrix</code> (a vector with a <code>dim</code> attribute) and a <code>data.frame</code> (a <code>list</code> of vectors). Learn how and when to work with <code>list</code>s or <code>array</code>s. Know the difference between <code>numeric</code> and <code>integer</code>. Read about floating points.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Learn how and when yo use <code>lapply/sapply/vapply</code> - these could come useful many times</p>
</li>
<li><p>You <em>must</em> learn some <code>?regex</code>. Must.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Read <code>?S4groupGeneric</code> in order to discover which functions have <code>data.frame</code> methods (a very useful to know).</p>
</li>
<li><p>Learn about <code>?methods</code></p>
</li>
<li><p>Read <code>?strptime</code> very carefully (note the <code>Sys.setlocale(&quot;LC_TIME&quot;, &quot;C&quot;)</code> part - could be a life saver).</p>
</li>
<li><p>Read the damn docs. R has awesome documentation- please use it. You won't find anything even nearly as good in any other language (I know of).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Like Barry Rowlingson once said: &quot;<strong>This is all documented in TFM. Those who WTFM don't want to have to WTFM again on the mailing list. RTFM.</strong>&quot;</p>

<p> I am a Digital Nomad who is ready to work remotely from anywhere in the world.</p>
<p>⏱ Software development has become my passion since I first wrote my first piece of code in the Turbo Pascal programming language as a child, using my father's personal computer. I still live with this passion and already have 8+ years of development experience in the IT industry.</p>
<p> I started my professional career by developing a multi-user web application for the outsourcing company Rubius in 2015.</p>
<p> Then I worked for 1.5 years at the Kazakhstan Stock Exchange (KASE) on FinTech projects. I managed to develop 4 financial and analytical web projects for KASE during this time.</p>
<p> I am proud that I worked for one of the largest telecommunications companies in Central Asia during the period from 2018 to 2020. VEON management entrusted me with the creation of scalable, fault-tolerant, distributed Big Data systems in a microservice architecture in 7 different projects.</p>
<p> I am passionate about the AWS ecosystem. My deep dive into the details of its cloud products began in the fall of 2020 when I was invited to develop a SaaS platform from scratch at the SmartLab company. The result of my work was the sale of the startup I was working on to the largest Asian telecommunication company called &quot;Kazakhtelecom&quot; JSC.</p>
<p> My AWS journey continued at River Island throughout 2023. I was excited to contribute to the company's technological evolution, driving transformative advancements in the retail industry.</p>
<p> I usually use Golang for Backend Development, JavaScript for Frontend Development, Scala for Data Engineering, and Python for Data Science.</p>
<p> I have a Master's Degree in Information Systems and Technologies from Tomsk Polytechnic University.</p>
<p> I have experience working in startups and big companies. I have implemented dozens of successful projects that have made life easier for thousands of users. You can easily find details of some of these projects on my GitHub repository.</p>
<p> Feel free to contact me with your ideas and suggestions!</p>

To work with people from all over South India and part of United States is very rewarding. Hosur, Salem, Coimbatore and Bengaluru are some of the places I have worked with. Well not the place itself, but people living there.</p>

<p>I have successfully been a programmer now for a while and it has given me even more love for this work.</p>

<p>I have coded websites with great respect to standards, because it makes life easier for everybody. My site even used to validate, honestly!</p>

<p>My first program was a Turing machine adder, I ran it by hand with paper tape, pen and eraser.</p>
<p>I was lucky to have access to a <a href=""http://www.feb-patrimoine.com/projet/ge55/ge58.htm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Honeywell Bull GE-58</a> mini computer with a 6 digit display, 10000 octets of core memory and a couple of 2.4 MB hard drives. It needed 15KW of electrical power. I still remember the Hollerith code for punching cards manually, and used to program in machine code directly.</p>

I also teach awfully bright students at the University of Sheffield. I teach advanced Web Technologies, another topic that looks horribly boring until you discover it is about doing cool things with Twitter and Facebook. 
Some of my undergrads have won competitions and even presented their results to the Prime Minister. Some of them have become PhD students and now are academics or researchers themselves. Others after their PhDs have become CEOs/CTOs and Chief Officers of companies we have created together. That probably means that I am old, because only old people can boast about the great achievements that their children have in life.</p>

The languages that I am familiar with are Java, Python and SQL.</p>

<p>I also possess a strong background in Philosophy (I got my BA in this field, along with Psychology--which I hated, by the way, as the department was headed by of a bunch of pretentious elitists producing an unbecoming amount of sound and fury regarding the presumed fact that Psychology is in fact a science, when I myself had absolutely no interest in studying it as one, as I was a proponent of psychoanalysis, finding behaviorism to be both manipulative and fascist--, graduating Western Kentucky University with the status of Magna Cum Laude honors. I still maintain a great affinity for Philosophy and I'm honestly still considering returning to the subject once I get my MS in Computer Science to get my PhD in Philosophy so that I have the career options of either being a computer programmer or a philosophy professor. I have also found that the knowledge of formal logic provided by philosophy has been very useful in my programming pursuits.</p>

<p>I am also a musician who, among other things, has been playing guitar for ten years now. I've been in numerous bands/projects. I also like to involve myself in the theater and the arts. I began my studies as a Fine Arts major at WKU, with a focus in drawing and painting, before I changed my major to Philosophy and Psychology.</p>

<p>I'm a Physics PhD in Hungary, specializing in ultrafast science, condensed-matter physics, and laser-matter interaction. I'm working with material simulations (DFT, TDDFT, MD...) using codes like Quantum Espresso, Octopus, AMS-SCM, Yambo, etc., and am a highly-skilled scientific Python programmer. I also have a great knowledge of C and Bash, as well as a slight droplet of wisdom in Fortran and Java. Currently I'm working in ELI-ALPS as a part of the PANOSC-VINYL, an EU-funded project aiming to develop a complete start-to-end photon and neutron beamline simulation system - including the simulation of source, propagation, sample, beam-matter interaction, and signal detection - as an open-source package in the framework of the Open Science initiative.</p>

<li>Environmental issues including depletion of resources and global warming</li>
<li>Social collapse due to decreasing birth rates.</li>

<ul>
<li>Trying to fully parse serialized (non-regular) patterns</li>
<li>Using an unnecessarily complicated single expression when multiple is better</li>

Then i joined Medma Infomatix pvt ltd, Lucknow as a Trainee Software Engineer. I got trained in various technology like Html,CSS and Bootstrap, JavaScript, Electron, then finally android which i wanted since i love to code in java.</p>

<p>I believe that software is a tool which improve so many of our activities: by providing software we can open so many possibilities. Building software means to provide tools for everyone.</p>

<p>To me, programming is a way of looking at things.
As a painter understand the world through his art, I use programming as a way to reason about phenomena and model them.
I think programming is now pervading so much of our life.</p>

<p>I Believe Dream is not the thing you see in sleep, dream is the thing which does not let you sleep.</p>

<p>There are two aspects of software development that inspire me: Problem Solving and Software Design. I always wanted to become an architect... as a programmer, I often compare software with a building and like to extend their principles to each other. As an example, I find the architecture principle, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Form_follows_function"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Form Follows Function</a>, very useful for UI design.</p>
<p>I find myself to be a perfectionist and cannot find any better way to describe perfection:</p>

<p>Perfection is achieved, not when there is nothing more to add, but
when there is nothing left to take away.</p>

It wasn't until I pursued a degree in Management and Information Technology at the University of Kelaniya that I discovered my love for all things tech. Since then, I've been on a mission to upskill myself and explore new and exciting challenges.</p>
<p>I'm proud to call myself a Data Engineering professional, with a knack for Python and a black belt in SQL. I'm a big fan of cloud services, especially Azure and AWS, and love building efficient pipelines with Airflow, Spark, and Databricks. Speaking of Databricks, have you checked out their Lakehouse architecture? It's like the Avengers of data platforms - powerful and revolutionary.</p>
<p>I'm all about building cloud-agnostic data pipelines and exploring the intersection of Software Engineering and Data Engineering. Flask, Docker, and Kubernetes are my trusty sidekicks in this adventure, helping me to create efficient, scalable solutions that would make even Iron Man proud.</p>
<p>I've earned my stripes in the tech world with certifications in Azure, Databricks, and AWS Solutions Architect Associate.</p>
<p>I started my journey as a humble Open Source Contributor, making small contributions and gradually building my way up to a Communinty Maintainer at MindsDB. Today, I'm proud to say that I'm work as a Data Integrations Enginner for them, where I collaborate with fellow tech enthusiasts. Contributing to the open source community has been a fulfilling experience that has allowed me to stay on top of the latest tech trends while giving back to the community that has given me so much.</p>

I have produced several client server database systems, such as Hotel Front Office, Distribution, P.O.S, Graphic System, Queue Systems, Auto Service and Dealer, and some other systems that interacts with integrated devices. I have great interest in Web and Mobile programming especially using current technologies such as Node.js, Vue, React, Android and Flutter.
In my spare time I used to teach several programming classes and I have been helping university students to create their thesis in programming.</p>

<p>I like to share knowledge. I've been helped by programming community and sites from all over the world via internet, and I realize what that makes us progress is Collaboration. So sharing knowledge is an important aspect for us human to continually grow in technology and benefit from applied technologies.</p>

<p>To me, programming is an on going evolution. You just can't stop adapting to new technologies. How ever the most important thing is to be able to produce a fully functional program that is useful and will help users to achieve their business or organizational goal. </p>

<p>My motto in programming is : (Study...Share..Produce) times Infinity</p>

11027506,15283975,Nipun Tharuksha,2019-02-07T09:32:55.280,"<p>I started my career in 2014 as a production executive at <a href=""https://www.hayleys.com/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Hayleys</a>, one of the largest organizations in Sri Lanka. In the same year, I also started an external degree program BIT at UCSC. However, I was not able to complete the degree as I needed 0.2 more for the GPA. Nevertheless, I completed the final year project with a B+ and also obtained a diploma in information technology.</p>
<p>In 2016, while still working as an executive, I started freelancing web development projects and taught myself various programming languages. In September 2019, I switched my career to become a full-time software engineer, after being asked to join as a project lead by one of my freelancing employers. This was the turning point of my IT life. I knew that the employer trusted my capabilities, or else they wouldn't have asked me to join with them. I resigned from there after nine months and then joined a local company as a software engineer, where I worked for four months before moving on.</p>
<p>The following year, I worked for an international startup in the medical industry, where I handled several projects as the company grew. During this time, I also had the opportunity to interview candidates for the company and conducted a total of 187 interviews, selecting only 12 candidates.</p>
<p>In August 2021, I resigned from the startup as a senior software engineer and subsequently worked for several companies as a senior software engineer, specializing in Laravel, Vue, and AWS technologies. I develop projects from requirement gathering to deployment, and if you would like to learn more about my career story, please visit my <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/nipun-tharuksha/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">LinkedIn</a> profile.

<p>I love working as an embedded SW developer, even though we are underestimated among the programmers community.
In fact, resource limitations lead to everyday issues that &quot;normal programmers&quot; can't even imagine: limited stacks (no recursion), limited heap (byte-wise management of the memory) and limited HW force developers to be creative to fit their requirements, even if this could mean to give away code structures. Finally, debug tools can be very limited: no debugger (-&gt; debug through log prints) or even no prints (-&gt; debug changing GPIO states and monitoring them with an oscilloscope).</p>

I'm skilled in developing tools for lab experiments and post-analysis on vast amounts of data. I'm no stranger to long hours, with previous work experience as a lifeguard, swimming instructor and karate instructor. Having grown up in an agricultural background, I've developed a diligent work-ethic and I believe my experience will make me a valuable team player in most any setting.</p>

<p>I graduated top in my class of 2019 with a BEng, Electronic and Computer Engineering from the University of Limerick, focusing my studies on a mixture of Digital and Active Circuit Design, Telecommunications, Artificial Intelligence and Machine Vision, with a mixture of Distributed Systems and Signals and Systems Analysis spread across the years too. For a cumulative 11 months I worked in the Design Evaluation lab in Analog Devices, International, working at test automation and data analysis on large bodies of data gathered over weeks and months.</p>

<p>In my spare time and throughout my time in college I've enjoyed Martial Arts, Rock Climbing, Cycling and Swimming, and in each I found part-time employment teaching and supervising in respective studios. These were some of the most enjoyable times I remember during college, and in no small way the time spent working and teaching children and adults taught me a huge amount about professionalism and work ethic.</p>

<p>I graduated high school math-and-science class, so when I decided to study philosophy rather than e.g. engineering, some considered it a ridiculous idea. Yet I had a clear vision for myself and followed it by gaining knowledge in fields of analysis, logic, heuristics and systems thinking (tip: having a beard or at least liking beards is recommended to study anything related to philosophy). The ability to make sense of the complexity of things by seeking relationships between them, helped me to discover a passion for working with data and numbers. Apart from being, well, a philosopher (which oblige me to have a beard, obviously), I am also a certified accountant and a Master of Business Management. Using my experience in business/financial analysis, I'm currently getting into the world of data science and machine learning! Have I mentioned the beard?</p>
